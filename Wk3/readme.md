Problem solving, and drawing machines. 

Understanding how a drawing machine can be constructed, creating automatic bio technological markings. 

Trial #1
- String, 
- Markers, 
- Cardboard, 
- Shower head, 
- Myself. 

It was not self automated, however the markings were imprinted at random due to the lack of control over the string. Further this, I looked to a different mode of mark making. 

Trial #2
- Dryer, 
- Watercolours,
- Water,
- Cardboard, 
- Myself. 

With the process of turning on the dryer, and then laid beneath was my card and colours that were spread from the force of the heat/ wind. Applying water at the same time allowed for the process to be elongated.
